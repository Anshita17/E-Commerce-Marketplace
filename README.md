 # Platform Used
 * Database: MySQL
# Data Preparation
Modified data types of key date-related columns to ensure consistent date formats across tables
Used SQL TRIM to remove any extraneous white spaces
Counted NULL values across tables to identify data quality issues and removed for data accuracy
Checks were performed on unique identifiers, such as customer_id and order_id, to detect and address duplicates
# High-Level Metrics Calculation

GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Month;
```

       DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS Month, 
       COUNT(order_id) AS Orders_Placed
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_id, Month
HAVING Orders_Placed > 1
ORDER BY customer_id, Month;
```

# Revenue from Existing vs. New Customers (Month on Month)
```sql
-- Calculate revenue by customer type (new or existing) month over month
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS Month,
       CASE WHEN MIN(order_date) = order_date THEN 'New' ELSE 'Existing' END AS Customer_Type,
       SUM(order_value) AS Revenue
FROM Orders
GROUP BY Month, Customer_Type
ORDER BY Month;

FROM Order_Items
GROUP BY Month, product_id, seller_id, category_id
ORDER BY Sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
# Top 10 Most Expensive Products
